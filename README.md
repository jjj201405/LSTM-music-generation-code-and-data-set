# Music Generation Project

This project utilizes TensorFlow 2.5 and Python 3.6 to generate music. Below are the key installation requirements and necessary packages for running the music generation code smoothly.

## Installation Environment

- **Python Version**: Python 3.6 is required. Make sure it is properly installed on your system as it serves as the base for running the code.
- **TensorFlow Version**: TensorFlow 2.5 should be installed. You can install it via `pip install tensorflow==2.5` in your command line.

## Required Packages

In addition to TensorFlow and Python 3.6, the following Python packages are needed for music generation:

- **Music21**: A powerful library for music analysis and manipulation, which can be installed using `pip install music21`.
- **NumPy**: Essential for numerical computations in Python. Install it via `pip install numpy`.
- **Matplotlib** (optional): Useful for visualizing music-related data. Install it with `pip install matplotlib`.

## Repository Content

The source code for the music generation algorithm, along with the dataset used for training, are both uploaded to this GitHub repository. Feel free to explore the code, contribute, or use it as a reference for your own music generation projects.
